<h1>Array Methods & Callback Functions</h1>
<p>This exercise will demonstrate the use of both common array methods (filter, map, foreach) and also provide an
    explanation of callback functions. Callback functions are functions that are passed into another function
    as a parameter, so that they may be executed later - in this case, the filter method takes in a function intended
    to determine whether an item should be filtered, the map method takes in a function intended to determine what value
    should overwrite the old value of the array, and the foreach method takes in a function intended to perform some
    action for each item. In all of these cases, the additional function supplied to the method is a callback function.
    </p>
<p>
By the way, why use both the terms function and method here? Functions are reusable blocks of code that exist
independently of any Object, whereas methods are reusable blocks of code that belong to an Object. Arrays are
technically objects.</p>
<h2>Original array:</h2>
<p id = "original">placeholder</p>
<h2>After filtering (only items with spaces are kept):</h2>
<p id = "afterFilter">placeholder</p>
<h2>After mapping (all items converted to uppercase)</h2>
<p id = "afterMap">placeholder</p>
<h2>After forEach, check the console for console outpod for every name (open the console with f12 or right click /
    developer tools)</h2>
<p>These are not the only array methods. You may also encounter sort & reduce, which also work with callback functions.</p>
