  <h1>Setting Attributes</h1>
  <p>You are already aware that JavaScript can be used to alter the InnerText of an element. Here we can demonstrate
  that JavaScript can also be used to modify the attributes of an element - for instance, the image URL used in
  an image element. This exercise also demonstrates the use of external JS files as well as an external stylesheet
  for the first time.</p>
  <p>Your goal will be to write the code in the linked JS file that will change the following image to display whatever
  image URL is provided in the text input.</p>
    <!-- image element that starts off with a non-image as its 'src' value (this will result in a broken image at the start)  -->
  <img id = "image" src = "placeholder">
  <br>
    <!-- a very wide input box to accommodate long links -->
  <input style = "min-width:800px" type = "text" id = "input">
  <br>
  <button id = "button">update the image</button>
  <p>some example urls to use:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>https://ia801201.us.archive.org/14/items/Chrysanthemum_20160913/Chrysanthemum.jpg</li>
      <li>https://ia601201.us.archive.org/14/items/Chrysanthemum_20160913/Hydrangeas.jpg</li>
      <li>https://ia801201.us.archive.org/14/items/Chrysanthemum_20160913/Tulips.jpg</li>
  </ul>
