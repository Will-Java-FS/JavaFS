    <h1>CSS styling</h1>
    <p>This exercise relies on inline CSS - style rules applied to an individual element, within the element itself.
    In total, there are three ways to introduce CSS: inline (as shown here), embedded (written in the HTML head),
    and external (written in a separate file.) External CSS is generally preferred because separating style rules into
    its own file results in a more efficient separation of concerns.</p>

    <p style = "font-style: italic" >This text is italic</p>
    <p style = "font-size: 30px" >This text is big</p>
    <p>Please make this text italic</p>
    <p>Please make this text small</p>
    <p>Research spike: put this text in the center of the screen (you'll have to look up how to do it)</p>
