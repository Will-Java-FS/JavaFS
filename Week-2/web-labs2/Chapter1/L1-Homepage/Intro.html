<!--html documents first define the type of document they are.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--the head of an html document contains various metadata for the site, in this case the character encodings,
title, and styling information.-->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Homepage instructions</title>
</head>
<!--the body of an html document contains the actual structure of the site.-->
<body>
    <!--h tags are block elements for heads.-->
    <h1>Making a beginning "homepage"</h1>
    <!--a p (paragraph) tag is a block element for general text.-->
    <p>To start, web development largely involves the creation and modifications of elements of a web site.
    <!--ol initiates an unordered list. ol initiates an ordered list.-->
    <ul>
        <!--li represents a list element.-->
        <li>HTML is necessary for defining the general structure of a site.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is the most common way to introduce interactivity & general programming capability to websites.</li>
        <li>CSS is the most common way to style websites and to introduce user-friendliness across any type of device.
            While it is useful, styling will be considered generally ancillary to our goals in web development and will
            be mostly ignored.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our real objective is to understand the flow of web development enough to prepare you to work with advanced
        JavaScript frameworks. The most natural place to start is going to be to write some of your own elements: check
        out YourHomepage.html, create the elements defined there, and open the html files in your web browser to see
        your progress.</p>
    <!--img is an inline element for images.-->

    <!--br is a line break.-->

    <!--a is an inline element for links.-->
    <a href = "YourHomepage.html">click here to proceed to your "homepage" in the browser!</a>
