<h1>Async & Await</h1>
<p>This exercise will demonstrate asynchronous programming with Async & Await for the first time. First, it is key to
understand that JavaScript is limited to running a single thread at a time (most languages feature some form of
multithreading, or the ability to handle multiple independent executions of code simultaneously). JavaScript also
needs to handle many events from the user or from the web while maintaining a pleasant and responsive user experience -
so, whenever JavaScript needs to wait for something to happen, such as waiting on a timer or on API calls, JavaScript
allows other events to fire while it's waiting - to do this, the developer must write "async" methods that
"await" for some operation to complete. "Async" and "await" are combined with the concept of Promises - which are values
that take time to resolve and require waiting (usually when interacting with external systems such as the web)</p>
<button id = "button">when clicking this button, this text should display "Success!". If you get [object Promise], you
    haven't properly resolved the promise via async/await.</button>
<p id = "text">click the button</p>
<script src = "AsyncAwait.js"></script>
