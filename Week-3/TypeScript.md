# TypeScript

- A superset of JavaScript
- Created by Microsoft
- provides more OOP Support than JS. It has (real) Classes and Access Modifiers.
- Has Interfaces
- Strongly type Language
- You cannot run a TypeScript file.
- TypeScript will be transpiled into JavaScript and that JS will be interpreted.
- Access Modifiers
  - Public, Private, Protected - function just like in Java.
  - (Non-access modifiers)
    - readonly - value cannot be changed and must be initialized when declared
- Data Types:
  - number, string, boolean, null, undefined, array, enum, void, any, never
  - Declaring variables:
    - variableName :DataType;
    - variableName: DataType;
    - variableName:DataType;
    - myNumber;
    - functionName(params) : returnType { }
- Advantages of TypeScript
  - More OOP Support
  - Strong Typing
  - Check for more errors at compile time.
